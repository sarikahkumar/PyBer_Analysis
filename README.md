- the average fare per driver is high in rural cities which was approximately around 8 times as that of urban cities and 2 times that of suburban cities
- the total number of rides, and drivers is lowest for rural cities, and highest for urban cities
- the total fare from urban cities is the highest which was approximately 2 times taht of suburban cities and 10 times that of rural cities

As evident from the figure,
- Urban cities earned highest fare during the period, followed by suburban and the lowest fares were      received in rural cities
- Common peak season appears to be during late February for all three cities, though April was also appeared to be a peak season in rural cities
- The peak fares charged in rural cities appear to be one-fifth of that charged by urban cities, and one-third of that charged by suburban cities
