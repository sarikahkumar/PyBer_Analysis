# PyBer Analysis
 
## **Overview of the analysis**
The purpose of this project is to:
-    Analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 of PyBer by creating a summary dataframe using Python and Pandas
-    Create a visualization (a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type) using Pandas and Matplotlib

---
## **Results**

The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types was done and a ride sharing summary dataframe was created to give better insight into the analysis. The results are provided below.

As evident from the above, 
- The average fare per ride is high in rural cities, and lowest for urban cities.
- The average fare per driver is high in rural cities which was approximately around 8 times as that of urban cities and 2 times that of suburban cities
- The total number of rides, and drivers is lowest for rural cities, and highest for urban cities
- The total fare from urban cities is the highest which was approximately 2 times taht of suburban cities and 10 times that of rural cities

### **Total ride fare based on city types**

A visual representation of total ride fare based on city types from 01-01-2019 to 28-04-2019 is provided below.

As evident from the figure,
- Urban cities earned highest fare during the period, followed by suburban and the lowest fares in rural cities
- Common peak season appears to be during late February for all three cities, though April was also appeared to be a peak season in rural cities
- The peak fares charged in rural cities appear to be **one-fifth** of that charged by urban cities, and **one-third** of that charged by suburban cities
---
## **Summary**


The reason for high average fare per driver, and high average fare per ride, is highest in rural cities due to low number of rides and drivers in rural cities. Similarly, highest total fare, and largest number of drivers contributed to low average fare per ride, and per driver for urban cities.


Based on the above results, we recommend the following for addressing any disparities among the city types.


- Recruit more drivers in rural cities so as to improve ride number
- A feasibility study and market penetration research to be done for rural cities, to understand the demand for PyBer rides
- Lower the fare per ride in rural cities, to encourage people to take more rides in rural cities, i.e. to improve demand
- As urban and suburban cities are the main contributors of top line and probably bottom line, no change in current fares, drivers, or rides is recommended at present.
